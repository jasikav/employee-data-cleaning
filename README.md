# Employee Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data cleaning and feature engineering using Python and Pandas on a real-world employee dataset.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- employee_id
- joining_date
- last_working_date
- department
- monthly_salary

## Problems Identified
- Dataset loaded incorrectly due to formatting issues
- Duplicate header row present
- Missing values in department and salary
- Invalid and missing date values

## Steps Performed
- Inspected and validated raw data
- Fixed formatting and delimiter issues
- Removed duplicate header rows
- Converted columns to appropriate data types
- Handled missing values logically
- Engineered a new feature: employee tenure (in days)
- Exported a cleaned dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Output Files
- employee_data.csv (raw data)
- cleaned_employee_data.csv (cleaned data)

## Conclusion
The cleaned dataset is ready for further analysis or modeling. This project highlights practical data cleaning skills using Python.
